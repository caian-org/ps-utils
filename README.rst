*********************************************
PS-UTILS: Powershell Hacks to Reduce the Pain
*********************************************

About
=====

This is a dump repository for some of the powershell scripts I used to use when
dealing with Office 365. Some were blatantly copied from somewhere on the
internet, some were adapted to specific uses.

Powershell has such a weird syntax, isn't it?


Requirements
============

Powershell and a compatible operating system.


License
=======

To be fair, I'm not sure. As I said, most were found on the internet (without a
copying disclaimer), so I'm not sure to what extend you can use it. I suppose
you can copy and redistribute, since that's what I've done back then and now.
